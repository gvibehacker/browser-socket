# Contributing to browser-socket

Thank you for your interest in contributing to browser-socket! This project enables real TCP networking in browsers, and we welcome contributions that help expand its capabilities.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Basic understanding of TCP networking and WebSockets

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/browser-socket.git
cd browser-socket
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
# Server
cd server && npm install

# Client
cd ../client && npm install

# Cloudflare Worker
cd ../cf-worker && npm install
```

3. **Build and test:**

```bash
# Server
cd server && npm run build

# Client
cd ../client && npm run build

# Cloudflare Worker
cd ../cf-worker && npm run build
```

4. **Run examples:**

```bash
# Start demo server (Node.js bridge)
cd examples/bridge && npm install && npm start

# OR deploy Cloudflare Worker (requires wrangler CLI)
cd examples/cloudflare-worker && npx wrangler deploy

# Open examples in browser
open examples/web-server/index.html
open examples/dns/index.html
```

## üìã How to Contribute

2. Describe the use case and benefit
3. Consider implementation complexity
4. Be open to discussion and alternatives

### üîß Code Contributions

#### What We Need Help With

- **Protocol improvements** - Enhance the binary wire protocol
- **Performance optimizations** - Reduce latency and improve throughput
- **Browser compatibility** - Test and fix issues across browsers
- **Cloudflare Worker features** - Leverage new CF Workers APIs and capabilities
- **Error handling** - Better error messages and recovery across all implementations
- **Documentation** - API docs, tutorials, examples for all bridge types
- **Examples** - Creative demos showing new possibilities with both bridges
- **Security** - Audit and improve security measures for all deployments

#### Development Guidelines

1. **Follow existing patterns:**

   - Look at existing code style and conventions
   - Use the same libraries and utilities already in the codebase
   - Match naming conventions and file structure

2. **Keep dependencies minimal:**

   - **Node.js server**: No third-party libraries except built-in modules and `ws` WebSocket library
   - **Client-side code**: Vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript with Web APIs only
   - **Cloudflare Worker**: Use only Cloudflare Workers APIs and Web Standards

3. **Write modular, readable code:**

   - Prioritize readability over premature optimization
   - Keep functions focused and well-named
   - Add comments for complex protocol logic

4. **Test your changes:**
   - Verify examples still work with both Node.js and Cloudflare Worker bridges
   - Test with multiple browser types (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Check client functionality with both bridge implementations
   - Test Cloudflare Worker deployment if applicable

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch:**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. **Make your changes:**

   - Follow the coding guidelines above
   - Keep commits focused and well-described
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Test thoroughly:**

   - Build client, server, and Cloudflare Worker packages
   - Run existing examples with both bridge types
   - Test your new functionality across implementations
   - Verify Cloudflare Worker deployment works if modified

4. **Submit the PR:**

   - Use the pull request template
   - Describe what you changed and why
   - Link any related issues
   - Include testing instructions

5. **Respond to feedback:**
   - Be open to suggestions and changes
   - Update your branch as requested
   - Maintain a collaborative attitude

## üèó Architecture Notes

### Key Components

- **Server (`/server/src/`)**: Node.js WebSocket transport and TCP connection handling
- **Client (`/client/src/`)**: Browser-compatible TCP socket API
- **Cloudflare Worker (`/cf-worker/src/`)**: Cloudflare Workers WebSocket bridge with connect API
- **Examples (`/examples/`)**: Demo applications for both bridge types

### Wire Protocol

- 8-byte header: Length(24) + Flag(8) + StreamID(32)
- Flags: DATA(0), SYN(1), ACK(2), FIN(4), RST(8), LISTEN(16), WINDOW_UPDATE(32)
- Stream multiplexing with unique IDs
- Binary payload for efficiency
- Window size control with 3-byte values in SYN, ACK, and WINDOW_UPDATE frames

#### Protocol Design Principles

- **Client-triggered actions should not trigger event emission** - Actions initiated by the client should not cause events to be emitted back to the client to prevent feedback loops
- **Invalid protocol format should trigger reset of stream** - Any malformed or invalid protocol data should immediately reset the affected stream to maintain protocol integrity
- **RST is a final state and should not trigger further actions** - Reset frames represent terminal state and should not generate replies or additional payload processing

### Testing Strategy

- Manual testing with examples using both Node.js and Cloudflare Worker bridges
- Cross-browser compatibility checks (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Performance testing with multiple connections across bridge types
- Protocol compliance verification for all implementations
- Cloudflare Worker edge testing and deployment verification

## üîí Security Considerations

- Never expose sensitive data in logs
- Validate all input data across all bridge implementations
- Implement proper access controls for both Node.js and Cloudflare Worker deployments
- Consider rate limiting and DoS protection (leverage Cloudflare's built-in protection for Worker bridge)
- Use secure WebSocket connections (WSS) in production
- Follow Cloudflare Workers security best practices when contributing to CF Worker bridge

## üìö Documentation

### Code Comments

- Comment complex protocol logic
- Explain non-obvious design decisions
- Document public APIs clearly
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

### Examples

- Create clear, focused examples for both Node.js and Cloudflare Worker bridges
- Include step-by-step setup instructions for both deployment types
- Show both basic and advanced usage patterns
- Test examples across browsers with both bridge implementations
- Include Cloudflare Worker deployment instructions (wrangler.toml, etc.)
